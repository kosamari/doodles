# Note  

Here are some feedbacks from people. (I might update the doodle later.)
- SHA-1 has been officially deprecated and not considered cryptographically valid for quite a while (@rustyk5)
- "Kinda easy to collide SHA-1" is more like 110GPU years (@rustyk5)
- May make sense to insert a "cryptographic" before "hash" in some places (@cramforce)
